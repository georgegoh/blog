:summary: Highlights of KubeCon EU 2018

KubeCon in Europe this year was held in the city of Copenhagen in Denmark, 
spanning 3 days from 2-4 May (with an additional workshop day on 1 May).

This is part 3 of a multi-part report on my time at the conference. I cover the
highlights(for me) of the conference in this post. In this series, I'll cover the 
pre-show, keynotes, topics of interest, and last, but not least, hallway 
conversations in the conference!

= Conference Highlights 

On of the best things about attending a conference as large as KubeCon is the
quality and volume of content. The obvious problem with this, is that there 
were often multiple talks that I wanted to attend, that were all happening 
at the same time.

The highlights in this post reflect the topics that I'm interested in, but are 
also influenced by what talks I could attend.

== Code Quality

Dan Kohn link:https://kccnceu18.sched.com/event/DurL/keynote-how-good-is-our-code-dan-kohn-executive-director-cloud-native-computing-foundation[talked]
about software code quality, and how important it is to incorporate testing and
continuous integration into the software development process. He emphasized his
point using link:https://www.sqlite.org[SQLite] as an example, where even with 
100% branch test coverage, millions of test cases, and about 1000x as much
test code as product code, a security-oriented link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing['fuzzer']
named link:http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/[American Fuzzy Lop] found 
link:https://lcamtuf.blogspot.dk/2015/04/finding-bugs-in-sqlite-easy-way.html[22 crashing test cases]
in the software.

I think this slide says it all:

Elsewhere in the conference, link:https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold[skaffold]
was a hot topic, as Google shared their Continuous Development approach using this.

James Strachan from CloudBees also

pipelines, previews, and GitOps style environment promotions.

== User Stories

=== Adidas

Daniel Eichten(adidas) and Oliver Thylmann(Giant Swarm) shared the Adidas'
experience of moving to Kubernetes.

In 2013, Adidas was moving from a hosting provider back into an internal 
data center. Their initial course of action was to get a quote for the migration
from their suppliers and partners, but the costs were just too high, because
moving an application consisted of many manual steps, which added to complexity
of implementation.

Docker was identified as a potential technology to reduce the cost of the move,
but was not supported at that time by Red Hat(Adidas' corporate platform 
standard), so their first cut of the data center move was done using Puppet
to orchestrate VMs.

Fast forward to 2015, and the following blocks fell into place:

* Kubernetes 1.0

* Docker supported by Red Hat
* Michael Vogele named as CIO, and he was keen to try new things and not afraid of failure.

Initially picking a smaller market with fewer users(Finland), Adidas built their Kubernetes
cluster to serve the frontend for the Finland site. This allowed their in-house engineers
to build up expertise and confidence in operating these clusters on AWS.

Today Adidas' frontend across all their geographies is served by Kubernetes clusters.
