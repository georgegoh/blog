:summary: Keynotes at KubeCon EU 2018

KubeCon in Europe this year was held in the city of Copenhagen in Denmark, 
spanning 3 days from 2-4 May (with an additional workshop day on 1 May).

This is part 2 of a multi-part report on my time at the conference. I cover the
keynotes in this post. In this series, I'll cover the pre-show, keynotes, topics of 
interest, and last, but not least, hallway conversations in the conference!

= Keynotes 

I'm not going to describe every keynote in detail, but only the ones that resonated with me:

== Anatomy of a Production Kubernetes Outage
_Oliver Beattie, Head of Engineering, Monzo Bank_

Oliver walked through a production outage that Monzo experienced in 2017. 

Current account customers were experiencing payment failures after the
deployment of a new service. However, even after rolling back the deployment,
the failures remained and the outage continued.

Eventually, the failure was traced back to an incompatibility of the version of
linkerd that they were using, and their version of Kubernetes(see 
https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/issues/1219).

I'm glossing over a lot of details here - more can be found at the following

== Switching horses midstream: the challenge of migrating 150+ services to kubernetes
_Sarah Wells, Technical Director for Operations and Reliability, Financial Times_

FT started their container journey in 2015, starting with home-grown orchestration
for their containers.

I liked this presentation for the architecture and roadmap described.

Because of the legacy Docker architecture, FT chose to go with a parallel
deployment approach - deploying releases to both their existing infra *and*
to Kubernetes. At first, they had code in separate branches - one for legacy,
one for Kubernetes. However, they quickly found it difficult to manage merging 
the separate branches containing the different deployment mechanisms to the two 
stacks, and ended up using if/else conditions instead. 

FT also had a slide showing the 3-year cost of ownership.

Going to Kubernetes reduced the cost of hosting by almost 50%, due to the
increased efficiency afforded by moving from VM-based, and home-grown Docker
workloads towards container-based Kubernetes workloads. Support costs also
decreased by a significant proportion - FT could leverage on the expertise
and work from the Kubernetes community, where previously, only tribal knowledge
existed to help architect, deploy and run their custom solution.

Assuming migration costs reduce significantly over time as applications become
increasingly Kubernetes-native, the figure suggests that total cost of ownership
on Kubernetes would be 50% less compared to their old stack after the 3 years of
initial migration.

A lot more details in the talk. Highly recommended watching.
